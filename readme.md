# GreenPulse: Urban Tree Health & Distribution Analysis

## Overview
GreenPulse is an exploratory data analysis project that analyzes urban forestry data from NYC OpenData to understand tree health, size distribution, and spatial patterns across boroughs.

## Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess large-scale urban tree census data
- Analyze tree health and diameter distributions
- Build interactive visualizations for policy insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Plotly, Dash
- Folium (Geospatial Mapping)

## Key Insights
- Most urban trees fall in the 5–10 diameter range
- Borough-level differences indicate varying urban forestry maturity
- Interactive dashboards enable stakeholder-driven exploration

## Skills Demonstrated
Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Spatial Analysis
